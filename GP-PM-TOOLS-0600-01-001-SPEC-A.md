# GAIA AIR Documentation Automation Tooling Specification

This specification defines the requirements for automated tooling used to create, validate, link, and manage the GAIA AIR documentation system. It outlines the critical functions tools must perform to ensure compliance with the Documentation Standards Business Rules (Rule A-I) and maintain coherence between product data, documentation, and the semantic knowledge graph (Rule F.33).

## 1. Overview

The complexity of the GAIA AIR project and the need for high levels of consistency, traceability, and machine-readability in its documentation necessitate the use of integrated automation tools. This document specifies the core capabilities required for these tools to support the documentation workflow, validate standards compliance, and facilitate the creation of a coherent digital thread from product data to semantic representation.

---

## 2. Core Tool Capabilities

Automated tooling for GAIA AIR documentation SHALL provide the following capabilities:

### 2.1. Document Creation Support (Related to Rule D.22)

*   **Requirement:** Provide standardized templates for common document types (Info Codes) to enforce structure and inclusion of mandatory metadata.
*   **Functionality:** Generate new documents based on selected templates; Pre-populate frontmatter metadata based on file location and user input (e.g., `partCode`, `domainCode`, `platformCode`, `seqCode`, `chapterCode`, `subjectCode`, initial `infoCode` and `revision 'A'`).

### 2.2. File Naming and Structure Validation (Related to Rules A.2, B.6-B.14, B.36)

*   **Requirement:** Strictly enforce the standardized file naming convention and the mapping between directory structure and chapter/subject codes. Validate Info Codes and Revision format.
*   **Functionality:** Automatically check file and directory names upon creation or modification; Verify that `chapterCode` and `subjectCode` in the file name match the logical structure; Ensure Info Codes in the name are from the [INFOCODE-INDEX]; Validate revision format; Flag or prevent saving/committing of non-compliant files.

### 2.3. Metadata Parsing and Validation (Related to Rule B.15)

*   **Requirement:** Parse standardized metadata blocks (YAML frontmatter) from Markdown files and validate their format and content. Ensure consistency between filename and metadata.
*   **Functionality:** Extract metadata into structured data; Validate that mandatory keys are present and follow defined types/formats; Verify that metadata values (e.g., `documentCode`, `infoCode`, `revision`) precisely match the file name components; Check consistency of linked metadata across related files (e.g., same platformCode).

### 2.4. Content Validation (Related to Rules C.16, C.20, C.25)

*   **Requirement:** Perform checks on document content, where possible, to ensure adherence to Info Code purpose, terminology, and data accuracy against master sources.
*   **Functionality:** (Advanced capability) Linter checks for inconsistent terminology or abbreviation usage (against defined glossaries - Rule D.25); (Advanced capability) Extract structured data from Markdown tables (e.g., BOMs, Req matrices) and validate against master product data (Rule C.16); Verify references to regulatory standards (Rule C.20).

### 2.5. Cross-Reference and Link Validation (Related to Rules F.30, F.31, E.27)

*   **Requirement:** Verify the integrity of internal and external links within documents.
*   **Functionality:** Check that relative and absolute internal Markdown links resolve to existing documents or anchors; Verify links to external references (`REF` documents, web links); Check links to visual assets (`FIG`, `DWG`, `VIS`) ensure files exist; (Advanced capability) Validate semantic links encoded within documents or derived metadata.

### 2.6. Output Generation and Transformation (Related to Rules A.5, F.33, H.40)

*   **Requirement:** Automatically generate ToC files and machine-readable semantic outputs (JSON-LD/RDF). Prepare documentation for various publication formats.
*   **Functionality:** Generate Table of Contents documents (`ToC-GP-XYZ.md`) by scanning directory structure and parsing document metadata; Export parsed metadata and validated content into JSON-LD/RDF using the ontology defined in GP-STD-ONT-0000-01-001-SPEC-A.md; Generate HTML/PDF versions for web browsing or formal release.

### 2.7. Version Control and Workflow Integration (Related to Rules G.34-G.37, H.38-H.40)

*   **Requirement:** Integrate automation checks into the version control and documentation workflow.
*   **Functionality:** Implement validation checks as pre-commit hooks or within CI/CD pipelines (e.g., running all validation tests upon pull request); Provide reporting on validation status to support the review and approval process; Ensure published outputs reflect approved revisions.

## 3. Toolchain Architecture (Conceptual)

*(This section would provide a high-level architectural view of the tooling, e.g., a set of scripts, a static site generator with plugins, a custom application)*

The tooling architecture SHOULD be modular and capable of integration into a Git-based workflow. Key components may include:
*   Git hooks for pre-validation checks.
*   A central processing engine (e.g., script runner, build system).
*   Parsers for Markdown and Metadata.
*   Validators interacting with the master product data source and Info Code/Ontology definitions.
*   Generators for outputs (ToC, JSON-LD, HTML/PDF).
*   (Advanced) Integration with the semantic graph database (Triple Store).

---

## 4. Implementation Plan (High-Level - References GP-PM Plans)

*(This section outlines how the tools will be implemented, developed, or acquired - detailed plans live under GP-PM)*

Implementation of these tools will be phased. Key steps include:
*   Phase 1: Develop/acquire validation tools for basic naming, metadata, and structure (aligns with initial enforcement of Rules A and B).
*   Phase 2: Develop/acquire parsing tools and core validation against structured data (aligns with enforcing Rule C.16 for BOMs/Specs).
*   Phase 3: Develop/acquire output generation tools (ToC, JSON-LD export).
*   Phase 4: Integrate tools into full CI/CD and workflow gates (aligns with Rules G, H).

Detailed plans for development, testing, deployment, and training related to these tools SHALL be documented in relevant GP-PM documents (e.g., Development Plans, Integration Plans).
