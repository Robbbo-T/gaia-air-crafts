## 3. Usage Guidelines

Info Codes are assigned to documents based on their primary purpose and content. Each document must have at least one Info Code, and multiple Info Codes can be assigned if a document serves multiple purposes. The Info Code(s) must be included in the document's metadata and filename, following the standard naming convention.

---

## 4. Conclusion

The Info Code Index is a critical component of the GAIA AIR documentation system, ensuring that all documents are consistently classified and easily identifiable. By adhering to the defined Info Codes and usage guidelines, we maintain a coherent and traceable documentation ecosystem.
