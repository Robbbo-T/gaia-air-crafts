# GP-PM-06-001-SPEC-A: Requirements for Automated Tooling in GAIA AIR Documentation System

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the requirements for automated tooling used to create, validate, link, and manage the GAIA AIR documentation system. The goal is to ensure compliance with the Documentation Standards Business Rules and facilitate the creation of a coherent digital thread from product data to semantic representation.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this document includes the following:
- Definition of requirements for automated tools
- Outline of critical functions tools must perform
- Guidelines for ensuring compliance with Documentation Standards Business Rules
- Facilitation of a coherent digital thread from product data to semantic representation

## 3. Requirements for Automated Tooling

### 3.1 General Requirements

1. The tools must support the creation, validation, linking, and management of documentation in the GAIA AIR system.
2. The tools must ensure compliance with the Documentation Standards Business Rules.
3. The tools must facilitate the creation of a coherent digital thread from product data to semantic representation.

### 3.2 Specific Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Creation

1. The tools must support the creation of documentation in Markdown format.
2. The tools must provide templates and guidelines for creating documentation that adheres to the Documentation Standards Business Rules.

#### 3.2.2 Validation

1. The tools must validate the consistency and correctness of the documentation.
2. The tools must check for compliance with the Documentation Standards Business Rules.
3. The tools must generate reports of any inconsistencies or errors found during validation.

#### 3.2.3 Linking

1. The tools must support the linking of documentation to structured data sources.
2. The tools must ensure that links between documentation and structured data sources are maintained and updated as needed.

#### 3.2.4 Management

1. The tools must support the management of documentation throughout its lifecycle.
2. The tools must provide version control and change tracking for documentation.
3. The tools must facilitate collaboration among multiple contributors.

### 3.3 Critical Functions

1. The tools must provide a user-friendly interface for creating, validating, linking, and managing documentation.
2. The tools must integrate with existing systems and workflows in the GAIA AIR documentation system.
3. The tools must support the generation of machine-readable semantic output (JSON-LD/RDF) from the documentation.

## 4. Compliance with Documentation Standards Business Rules

1. The tools must ensure that all documentation adheres to the Documentation Standards Business Rules.
2. The tools must provide mechanisms for enforcing compliance with the Documentation Standards Business Rules.
3. The tools must generate reports of any non-compliance issues and provide recommendations for resolving them.

## 5. Facilitation of a Coherent Digital Thread

1. The tools must facilitate the creation of a coherent digital thread from product data to semantic representation.
2. The tools must support the generation of machine-readable semantic output (JSON-LD/RDF) from the documentation.
3. The tools must ensure that the digital thread is maintained and updated as needed.

## 6. Conclusion

The requirements outlined in this document are intended to ensure that the automated tooling used in the GAIA AIR documentation system supports the creation, validation, linking, and management of documentation in compliance with the Documentation Standards Business Rules. By facilitating the creation of a coherent digital thread from product data to semantic representation, these tools will help ensure the consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the GAIA AIR documentation system.
