## 1. Introduction

This document defines the standard for classifying documents within the GAIA AIR project. It includes the mapping schema between different identification systems (IDs vs P/N) and provides guidelines for maintaining consistency across structured data sources, human-readable Markdown documents, and machine-readable semantic output (JSON-LD/RDF).

## 2. Mapping Schema

### 2.1 Identification Systems

The GAIA AIR project uses multiple identification systems to uniquely identify components, documents, and other entities. The primary systems are:

- **IDs (Identification Numbers):** Unique alphanumeric codes assigned to components and documents.
- **P/N (Part Numbers):** Unique alphanumeric codes assigned to parts and assemblies.

### 2.2 Mapping Schema Definition

The mapping schema defines the relationships between IDs and P/Ns. The schema ensures that each ID can be mapped to a corresponding P/N and vice versa. The schema is documented in the following table:

| ID         | P/N        | Description                          |
|------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| ID-001     | PN-1001    | Component A                          |
| ID-002     | PN-1002    | Component B                          |
| ID-003     | PN-1003    | Assembly X                           |
| ID-004     | PN-1004    | Assembly Y                           |

### 2.3 Examples of Mappings

#### Example 1: Component Mapping

- **ID:** ID-001
- **P/N:** PN-1001
- **Description:** Component A

#### Example 2: Assembly Mapping

- **ID:** ID-003
- **P/N:** PN-1003
- **Description:** Assembly X

## 3. Importance of Maintaining Consistency

Maintaining consistency between different identification systems is crucial for the following reasons:

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data remains accurate and reliable across different systems.
- **Traceability:** Facilitates tracking of components and documents throughout their lifecycle.
- **Interoperability:** Enables seamless integration between different systems and tools.
- **Compliance:** Ensures adherence to regulatory and industry standards.

## 4. Conclusion

This document provides the standard for classifying documents within the GAIA AIR project. By defining the mapping schema between different identification systems and emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistency, we ensure data integrity, traceability, interoperability, and compliance.
